## Overview

### Screenshot

!

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the box-sizing property in CSS. By using box-sizing: border-box;, I was able to control the element sizes more predictably. This property ensures that padding and borders are included in the total width and height of elements, which simplifies layout design and prevents overflow issues.


### Continued development
I plan to focus on improving my JavaScript skills by adding more interactivity to similar projects in the future. I also want to explore advanced CSS animations and experiment with more React projects.
